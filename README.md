# football-team-picker-project
This is the technical project set on our penultimate day at the Coding Fellowship to make for January 7th


## The brief

The exercise is to create a tool which randomly picks 5-a-side football teams from a list of 10 names.
It's up to you how you implement this, with JavaScript, PHP, as a web page, or as an app.

### Advanced features might include:

    • support for n-a-side, where a list of any length can be split into two teams
    • support for balancing of the teams, where some measure of each player's strength is used to allocate teams fairly


### Some suggestions

I would suggest you look to demonstrate clear thinking and good quality code.

If your tool requires a particular environment to run (e.g. Node or PHP) 
then this should be documented, or provided (e.g. Vagrantfile). 

In short: I shouldn't struggle to get it working on my local machine.
