# Football 5-a-side Random Team Picker Project
This is the technical project set on our penultimate day at the Coding Fellowship to make for January 7th


## The brief

The exercise is to create a tool which randomly picks 5-a-side football teams from a list of 10 names.
It's up to you how you implement this, with JavaScript, PHP, as a web page, or as an app.

### Advanced features might include:

    1. support for n-a-side, where a list of any length can be split into two teams
    2. support for balancing of the teams, where some measure of each player's strength is used to allocate teams fairly


### Some suggestions

I would suggest you look to demonstrate clear thinking and good quality code.

If your tool requires a particular environment to run (e.g. Node or PHP) 
then this should be documented, or provided (e.g. Vagrantfile). 

In short: I shouldn't struggle to get it working on my local machine.


# My initial notes

I would like to create the app with options for n-a-side teams, also for randomly picking team names, and creating top-trump style skills of players so that they can be balanced against eachother.

Need to do some research into what apps are out there and what elements it would need.

Initial names of the app could be: FTBLL-TM-Pckr, The beautiful game team picker (sub header), need to look up words that are synonymous with Football!

The MVP is randomly picking a 5-a-sdie football team from a list of 10 names, so initially I need:

1. to have an input where the user can enter 10 names, (should the names default to 10 initially or be empty? 
    -should this be single line? or have 10 spaces or 10 inputs? or a large text box that fits 10 names?

2. It should have a button that has 'Generate Team' or 'Pick your team' on it, which when pressed will places the 10 names into 5 a side teams.

## Additional Notes on Saturday 23rd after, 1st Draft of Wireframe (see pdf attached) initial set up and first changes:
1. have set up SASS on my project
2. Also have set up a background and the logo and favicon - this has allowed me to help with the formatting
3. Adding an input and thinking about the best way the user interface could work.
4. Will now do some more research into other apps to get some more ideas.

## Styling
There could be a background of a birds-eye view of a football pitch - so green grass with white stripes...can this be done with CSS? Ideas: https://codepen.io/eyecandy91/pen/dXLjNG  https://codepen.io/oloman/pen/ynJcl  https://codepen.io/paulnoble/pen/PwOxOY. With CSS I can easily do stripes like this: https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/3910382/568052803/stock-vector-football-pitch-icon-on-white-background-football-pitch-sign-symbol-568052803.jpg.
